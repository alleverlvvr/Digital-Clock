# Digital-Clock
This project is focused in creating a digital clock using python as a mini learning side project during undergraduate course. This includes use of simple functions and tkinter as GUI for interacting with the user. It is a group project consisting of 6 members who all made their additions to the project and presented as a whole to compile them into a single project. The project aims at using different aspects of a usual alarm clock combined with abilities to work as a stopwatch or a timer. It also incorporates use of sound of the alarm but is yet to be a put to test for few side cases. Many improvements have been made over time and the project is termed completed by us and brought to a halt. More changes might be brought to it if felt a need or bugs come in our notice. The project has been made open source for the moment as it is rather more of a learning phase project.
